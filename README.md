# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Build Process

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply after the build process, specifically in the production environment. The development server functions correctly.

## Bug Description

After running the build process (e.g., using a bundler like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup), Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to the elements in the production build. This results in the absence of styling applied through Tailwind CSS.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server (e.g., `npm run dev` or similar).
3. Observe that Tailwind CSS classes are applied correctly.
4. Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build` or similar).
5. Observe that Tailwind CSS classes are *not* applied in the production build.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the build process correctly processes your Tailwind CSS configuration files and injects the generated CSS into your production bundle. Common fixes include:

* Verify the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).
* Check for errors during the build process.  Console logs, browser devtools, and the build logs may give hints.
* Double-check the build pipeline to ensure your styles are correctly imported and bundled. 
* Confirm that the correct CSS file is included in your HTML.  There's often a separate CSS file generated by the build step that needs to be linked.
* Ensure `purge` or `content` options in your `tailwind.config.js` correctly identify source files. Missing files or incorrect paths can lead to missing classes after purging.
* Consider upgrading Tailwind CSS and related dependencies.

## Additional Notes

This bug is often tied to build configurations and how they interact with the way Tailwind generates and injects CSS. A careful review of your build process and Tailwind configuration is often the key to solving this problem.
